Belly Button Challenge 

In this homework I made an intaractive dashboard to explore Belly Button Bioiversity.  
The visuals are based on the user ID selectected in the dropdown menu.

## Set Up

The dataset catalogs the microbes that colonize the human navels is from this link: (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/)
I used JSON data from this site.
This homework utilizes both **html** and **Javascript** These are the main files to run the analysis. I primiariy utilized D3 and Plotly to create the intaractive dashboard.



## Project Report

I was surprised to learn how common microbial species really are. 

### **Important things to note:**
Bar Graph: Data markers  reflect the top ten OTU found in that individual.
